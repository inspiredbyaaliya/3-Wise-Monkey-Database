# 3 Wise Monkeys â€“ Inventory Management Database (MySQL)

This repository contains the **MySQL database** developed for the ISBS304 *Information System Project*.  
The system was designed for the **3 Wise Monkeys** hospitality venue in Sydney as part of a barcode-based inventory management solution.  

The database supports **real-time stock tracking, low-stock alerts, automated reordering, and audit logs**.

The design includes **four core tables**:

- **Users** â†’ role-based login (Admin/Manager/Bartender) with secure credentials.  
- **Items** â†’ stores product details, categories, quantities, suppliers, and locations.  
- **Reorder_Settings** â†’ defines minimum stock thresholds; triggers low-stock alerts.  
- **Stock_Log** â†’ audit trail of all stock movements (add/remove), linked to users and items.  

**Relationships (FKs):**
- `Stock_Log.user_id â†’ Users.user_id` (who performed the action)  
- `Stock_Log.item_id â†’ Items.item_id` (which product was updated)  
- `Reorder_Settings.item_id â†’ Items.item_id` (thresholds per item)
